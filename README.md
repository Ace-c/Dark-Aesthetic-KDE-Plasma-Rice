# Minimal-Desktop-KDE Plasma


If you want minimal, In my terms minimal means nothing on desktop...

0. Clear desktop - Remove panel or dock
1. Use KDE universal search for opening applications
2. Add transparency effect ---

   Go to setting - Window Management - Window Rule - Select Opacity and whatever you there .. Adjust it

3. Customize Terminal - Use neofetch with lolcat --- add this line to .bashrc - neofetch | lolcat, and whatever cmmd you want to colourize
4. Remove window decoration means Borders layout of application
5. If you want custom Icon - Edit it from Menu-Editor
