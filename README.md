# Minimal-Desktop-KDE Plasma


If you want minimal, In my terms minimal means nothing on desktop...

0. Clear desktop - Remove panel or dock
1. Use KDE universal search for opening applications
2. Add transparency effect ---

   Go to setting - Window Management - Window Rule - Select Opacity and whatever you there .. Adjust it

3. Customize Terminal - Use neofetch with lolcat --- add this line to .bashrc - neofetch | lolcat, and whatever cmmd you want to colourize
4. Remove window decoration means Borders layout of application
5. If you want custom Icon - Edit it from Menu-Editor
6. Keep only that application which is neccesary
7. For arch - Install application from official Repo that is pacman, If you want install package from AUR, check votes and PKGBUILDS

    In PKGBUILD check for source file... where it download its's package
    If voting is above hundred then it's mostly a popular package... and there is lots of eye on it...
